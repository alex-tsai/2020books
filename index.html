      <h3>escapism</h3>
      <p>Like many others, reading was a way to get a little escape during quarantine. Fantasy let me immerse myself in a story and world while humor was just a way to get a little levity during difficult times. The fantasy books also provided a nice blend, there's the messy politics of Dune, the intimacy of How's Moving Castle, as well as the Rhythm of War taking a look at the mental and emotional health of heroes. I usually read more Sci-Fi, but for some reason wasn't feeling the dystopic feel for some reason!</p>

      <h3>career</h3>
      <p>Books have continued to be helpful for me to navigate my career. Designing in the 21st century means designing for and within incredibly complex, interlocking systems. We design systems within systems and I wanted to have better language and frameworks for understanding them. Questions on how to do that kind of complex and creative thinking in the chaos, urgency, and pressures of today's workplace lead me to Manage Your Day-to-Day. Lastly, I had a chance to manage an intern this year and when she told me she liked The Making of a Manager, I felt like I should probably read it too (don't think I could be an actual manager based on what the book describes but being an intern manager was one of the most fulfilling things I've done so far).</p>

      <h3>refocusing</h3>
      <p>Coming into the new decade, I thought it'd be an opportunity to refocus in faith and life. Taking the time to reflect on what it means to depend on Jesus instead of myself, thinking a bit about purpose and character, as well as practically taking a look at habits. The rest of 2020 put a bit of a wrench in all that, but it still ended up requiring going back to the basics and thinking about the routines and mundane (like washing the dishes!).</p>

      <h3>race in america</h3>
      <p>With the national reckoning on race this year, I knew I also needed to spend more time learning. I've read articles, watched videos, and listened to podcasts but I don't think there's substitutes to learning through books. Ibram X. Kendi and Ijeoma Oluo lay out the history, statistics, and personal experience in a way that provided a lot more clarity to the personal and collective experience and injustices that Black people face in America. I want to be cautious about the stereotypes around Black men having to either be a rapper or athlete, but I've long admired Jay-Z and Kendrick and their work as artists and cultural strategists are inseparable from being Black. They also provide a stark reminder that no amount of money or success can help them escape racism, even at the top of their field they still face it regardless.</p>

      <h3>Behind the Scenes</h3>
      <p>I'm not sure why these "behind the scenes" type books looking at a person or institution made up so much of my reading this year. I think partly this is just the randomness of Libby waitlists, but I've come to realize that sometimes my primary motivation for reading may be curiosity. Learning not for the sake of applying, but just because I find it fascinating to pull back the curtain a bit and find out why. Why do people do the things they do or why do things happen the way they do. I think that shows in the breadth of subjects here from Chief of Staff to Chef or Silicon Valley to Sitcoms, I've learned this year if there's something that piques my curiosity there's probably a book for it.
